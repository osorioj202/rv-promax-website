<li><strong>Weight Capacity:</strong> Can range from 7,000 to over 20,000 pounds GVWR (Gross Vehicle Weight Rating).</li>
<li><strong>Living Space:</strong> Offers residential-style amenities including full kitchens, bathrooms, and separate bedrooms.</li>
<li><strong>Towing Stability:</strong> Reduced sway and improved maneuverability compared to bumper-pull trailers.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Who Should Consider a 5th Wheel?</h3>
